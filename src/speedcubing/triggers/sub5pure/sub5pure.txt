<h1>Pure triggers sub5</h1>

<p>
On this page you can find all DR triggers up to 4 move that start
with a DR-breaking move. Every trigger is paired with its "R2 variation",
for example R U R' is paired with R' U R'.
</p>

<p>
DRs are always on U/D with EO on F/B. The picture show the U face, the D face
and a 3D view of the cube. Click on pics to enlarge.

<p>Not much to say here</p>

<h2>2 moves</h2>

<p>Setups to this are hard to see.</p>

<h2>3 moves</h2>

<h3>Classic</h3>

<p>Classic triggers.<p>

! R U R; R' U R
! R U2 R;
! L U2 R;

<h3>Advanced</h3>

<p>These triggers are very short, but not easy to recognize. One trick
to set them up is to try build the oriented square + line, hoping that the
misoriented corners align well ("Radek's trick").</p>

! L U R; L' U R

<h2>4 moves</h2>

<h3>HTR-like</h3>

<p>These have many variations, try all of them to influence edges
or reduce to double slice.</p>

! R U2 B2 R; R' U2 B2 R

<h3>Edges only</h3>

<p>Try also L' U2 D2 R to solve the same case and influence edges.
The trigger R F2 B2 L is HTR-equivalent.</p>

! L U2 D2 R;

<h3>Inserted E2 variations of 3 movers</h3>

! R U D2 R; R' U D2 R
! L U D2 R; L' U D2 R

<p>For this last one, make sure corners are 4+4 and not 8+8.</p>

! R U2 D2 R;

<h3>5 corners, group 1</h3>

! R U F2 R; R' U F2 R
! R U' F2 R; R' U' F2 R

<h3>5 corners, group 2</h3>

! L U F2 R; L' U F2 R
! L U' F2 R; L' U' F2 R

<h3>6 corners, group 1</h3>

! R U D R;
! R U D' R;
! L U D R;
! L U D' R;

<h3>6 corners, group 2</h3>

! L R U R; L' R U R
