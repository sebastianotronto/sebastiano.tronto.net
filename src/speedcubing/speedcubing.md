![Me solving a Rubik's cube during an official competition](cubing.jpg "Me solving a cube")

I have been practicing
[speedcubing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing) since 2008,
and since 2011 I have competed in more than 70 officially recognized
[WCA](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org) competitions.
I am currently a senior member of the WCA Disciplinary Committee and
a WCA Junior Delegate.

I use the Roux method to solve the Rubik's cube in about 8 seconds
on average.  I currently hold the world record for the single best
result in the *3x3x3 Fewest Moves* event (16 moves), and some national
records in blindfolded events.  You can see all my official results
[on my WCA profile](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2011TRON02).

If you are interested in Fewest Moves solving, check out my [FMC
Tutorial](https://fmcsolves.cubing.net/). I also upload irregularly on
[my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianoTronto), but
most videos consist just of me solving the cube without any comment
or explanation.

Below you can find some links

## Beginner's stuff

* [Rubik's cube notation](notation), good to know before reading any
text-based tutorial.

## Software

* [Computer Puzzling](https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/compcube.htm) by
Jaap Scherphuis. If you are interested in implementing a puzzle solver,
do check out this page.
* [Nissy](https://nissy.tronto.net), a Rubik's cube solver and FMC assistant.

## Fewest moves

* [My FMC Tutorial](https://fmcsolves.cubing.net) - "old style" techniques,
no Domino Reduction.
* [Slice theory](slice-theory): optimizing DR solutions by inserting multiple
"slice" moves.
* [DR triggers](triggers): with pictures (work in progress / forever draft).
* [Reconstruction of my 22.00 former WR average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0yjjwxonEE),
including my 16 moves single (YouTube video).

## Blindfolded

* [My 3BLD algs for UBL/UR](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17sL1RuiYijTMiQkBn_d5xthdgAoxGE8oaH-Po-PZ58s/edit?usp=sharing).
They are outdated and not very good, I may upload a better version at some point.
