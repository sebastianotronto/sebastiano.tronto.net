![Me solving a Rubik's cube during an official competition](cubing.png "Me solving a cube")

I have been practicing [speedcubing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing)
since 2008, and since 2011 I have competed in 49 officially recognized
[WCA](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org) competitions. I currently hold the
world record for the single best result in the *3x3x3 Fewest Moves* event
(16 moves), and some national records in different blindfolded events. I am
also the leader of the WCA Disciplinary Committee. You can see all my official
results [here](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2011TRON02).

If you are interested in Fewest Moves solving, check out my
[FMC Tutorial](https://fmcsolves.cubing.net/). I also
upload irregularly on 
[my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianoTronto), but most
videos are just me solving the cube.
