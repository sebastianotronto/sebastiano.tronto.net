# Preparation

Alta Via 2 is not a hike one can do without planning. Obviously, one must
be sufficiently trained - though advanced climbing skills are generally
not needed, walking on steep mountain trails for multiple days requires
some experience and being in decent physical condition. But there is also
the logistics side of things: Where are you going to sleep? What and how
many clothes are you bringing?  Do they all fit in your backpack? And
what if it rains?

## Training

We started planning this around a year in advanced, so I had plenty
of time to train for this hike. Unfortunately, since I now live in
the Netherlands, I could not practice by actually walking in mountain
trails. My dad was luckier, because there are plenty of physically
demanding trains that start just a few minutes drive away from where
he lives.

So I replaced the actual hiking with two types of training: long-distance
running and gym-like leg exercises.

For the running part, I went for 6-12km run around twice a week. This
is something I enjoyed regardless of my goal of training for the hike;
I even decided to take part in a local half-marathon (21.1km) run.

The gym part was less entartaining for me, I never liked exercising
indoors.  But I managed to train somewhat consistently once or twice a
week for 15-30 minutes. My exercises included squats, side planks,
one-leg push-ups and the like. Boooring.

With all of this I was quite confident I was going to be in good
shape for the hike. I was more worried about the logistics...

## Planning the route

Most sources (including the one I followed, a red booklet that I
can't find online, but whose content is mostly summarized in
[this website](https://www.altavia2dolomiti.com/percorso))
suggest walking Alta Via 2 in 12 or 13 days, but in this way some of
the days consist of less than 5 hours of walking. On the other hand,
well-trained hikers could complete the whole route in 7 days or less. We
decided that 10 days would be a good middle ground for having a fun and
intense hike without overdoing it. In hindsight this was a good plan, but
I don't think I would have minded some of those short walking days.

For multiple reasons, we decided to sleep in huts rather than camping.
Since these regions tend to be quite popular with turists, we decided to
book our accommodations early on.  We started booking in May, thinking it
would be early enough, but it was not - at least for part in
[Südtirol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Tyrol).
None of the huts in our first two days of had any spare bed. We contacted
all the places that were somewhat close to our path, to no avail. In the
end we were forced to squeeze the first 3 days into 2, and make a long
detour to reach a nearby village to sleep in a B&B on our first night.

For the rest of the plan, the part following largely the border between
[Trentino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trentino) and the
[province of Belluno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Belluno),
was mostly fine. Not every hut in our original plan was available, but
we were able to find good alternatives nearby.

Our final plan was the following:

|:|:Start:|:Finish:|:Up (m):|:Down (m):|:Distance (km):|:Time (est.):|:GPX:|
|[Day 1](./day1)|Kreutztal|Lungiarü|
|[Day 2](./day2)|Lungiarü|Rifugio Pisciadù|
|[Day 3](./day3)|Rifugio Pisciadù|Rifugio Fedaia|
|[Day 4](./day4)|Rifugio Fedaia|Rifugio Flora Alpina|
|[Day 5](./day5)|Rifugio Flora Alpina|Rifugio Mulaz|
|[Day 6](./day6)|Rifugio Mulaz|Rifugio Pradidali|
|[Day 7](./day7)|Rifugio Pradidali|Rifugio Passo Cereda|
|[Day 8](./day8)|Rifugio Passo Cereda|Rifugio Boz|
|[Day 9](./day9)|Rifugio Boz|Croce d'Aune|

TODO download GPX files
TODO complete table
 
TODO if adding time estimate column,
     comment on the fact that the time estimates were off because
     going down became much thougher from day 3
     how much info is worth adding? add / remove columns

For the first and last days, the plan was to have someone bring us there
or pick us up, so we spent only 8 nights out.  We did not realize at the
time, but this plan gave us a nice balance between high mountain huts
(for the real mountaineering experience) and proper hotels (for better
comfort); after all, every one of these hotels was also called *rifugio*
(or *hütte* in German, or *utja* in [Ladin](TODO link) TODO check
speling of utja).

## Packing up

You may find it silly, but fitting all the necessities in my backpack
was the part of this adventure that I was most worried about. We were
going to hike for 9 days, but clearly we could not pack 9 sets of clean
clothes; that alone would almost fill our backpacks. And it's not just
t-shirts and underwear, we needed warm and waterproof clothes too. And
what about food? The huts served dinner and breakfast, but we definitely
needed something to eat throughout the day, too.

In the end, this is what we packed:

TODO check the technical terms

### Hiking gear

* Hiking boots
* TODO bastoni da montagna
* TODO corda e moschettone
* Two water bottles (0.5L + 1L). The smaller one was a thermos-like bottle
  to keep the contents warm, but I ended up never filling it with hot
  water or tea. It would have been better to just bring two lightweight
  plastic bottles.
* Maps. TODO chiedi a papà i numeri delle cartine tabacco.

### Clothes

TODO some intro about most of my clothing was some synthetic fiber
     that dries up quickly (although in practice it was extremely humid)

* TODO 4 magliette tecniche, ne bastavano 2-3
* TODO pantaloni da montagna
* TODO felpa super leggera ma che teneva caldo
* TODO mutande tecniche 4 paia, anche qui 2-3 bastavano
* TODO un cambio completo (mutande, calzini, maglietta, maglia a maniche
  lunghe, pantaloncini) non tecnico, per stare in rifugio.
* TODO una felpa pesante che non ho mai usato, quella leggera è bastata
* Slippers.
* A baseball cap.
* A rain poncho. I did not like using it, because it made me sweat a lot
  and I ended up getting wet anyway. But in some moments it was necessary.
* Rain trousers. I ended up never using these, my regular hiking trousers
  were somewhat waterproof, and the rain poncho covered all the rest.
* Gloves. Temperatures reached close to 0°C,
  and gettings your hands wet with near-freezing rains is not fun.

### Food and medicine

* The only food we pack were protein bars. We brought 3 per person per
  day, but this was way too much. I ended up eating one per day (TODO was
  it around 100g?) on average, because we were often able to eat something
  (like a slice of [*Strüdel*](TODO link)) in the huts we walked by during
  the day.
* [Energy tablets](TODO link or something). Some quick source of energy boost,
  they were mostly vitamins with some caffeine.
* Plasters, both regular ones and [blister platers](TODO link?)
* Painkillers and other basic medicine: (TODO list: naproxene, paracetamol)

### Other stuff

TODO maybe move this stuff in the other sections above

* Sleeping bag. A very light one (TODO cerca nome in inglese
  del sacco lenzuolo) is enough, since every hut provided heavy
  blankets, but not (TODO nome delle lenzuola da sotto?)
  TODO add that one must use it, it's a rule in most huts.
* One towel, [the most important piece of equipment](TODO link hitchhiker's guide or smth).
* Soap, toothbrush and toothpaste.
* Wet wipes.
* Wallet, phone, phone charger and a power bank. The only app I used was
  [Organic Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.organicmaps),
  an offline maps app based on
  [OpenStreeMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/46.5905/11.7540) data.
  Also available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/app.organicmaps/).
* A small planner and a pen, to keep a journal of the trip.

TODO add picture of me with backpack?

At 12kg water included, the backpack is quite heavy. I could have saved a
couple of kilos, but in the end we used almost everything that we brought.
