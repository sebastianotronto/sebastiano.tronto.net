Hello! I am a software developer based in Leiden, The Netherlands.

Previously I was a PhD student in Mathematics at the Universities of
Luxembourg and Leiden. You can check out my [list of papers](research)
and [my talks](talks).

During my free time I enjoy tinkering with my computer, [programming](git)
and playing with the [Rubik's cube](speedcubing).
