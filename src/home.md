![A picture of me](me2.jpg "Me")

Hello! I am a software developer based in Leiden, The Netherlands.

Previously I was a PhD student in Mathematics at the Universities of
Luxembourg and Leiden. You can check out my [list of papers](research)
and [my talks](talks).

During my free time I enjoy tinkering with my computer, [programming](git)
and playing with the [Rubik's cube](speedcubing).

In August 2025 I completed Alta Via 2, a 180km
hike across the Dolomites, together with my father. You can read about this
journey [in this page](./av2).
