![A picture of me](me.png "Me")

Hello! I am a scientific software engineer based in Leiden, The Netherlands.

Previously I was a PhD student in Mathematics at the Universities of
Luxembourg and Leiden. Check out my [list of papers and talks](research).

During my free time I enjoy tinkering with my computer, [programming](git)
and playing with the [Rubik's cube](speedcubing).
