# Rubik's cube: how to figure it out

Today I worked on something that does not quite fit with the theme
of this blog, and this is why I decided to have it as a separate page
rather than as a blog post. Nevertheless, I thought it would be worth
linking it here in case there are interested readers :)

In preparation for a presentation I am going to give in a couple of
weeks at a company meeting, I have written short tutorial about the
Rubik's cube:

[Rubik's cube: how to figure it out](../../speedcubing/figure-it-out).

This is not a complete guide, but rather a short writeup aimed at giving
you just enough tools to be able to solve it on your own. I think this is
an interesting approach that you won't find elsewhere by simply Googling
"how to solve a Rubik's cube".

See you next time for a post on the usual topics!
