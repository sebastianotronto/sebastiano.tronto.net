# Aaron Swartz

[Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) passed away
ten years ago, at the age of 26. During his short life he contributed
to multiple projects, including
[Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons),
[RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS),
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and
[reddit](https://www.reddit.com).

If you are interested in learning more about Aaron's life,
you can watch the biographical documentary
[*The Internet's Own Boy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet%27s_Own_Boy),
which is freely available online. You can also still access
[Aaron's website](http://www.aaronsw.com) and read
[his old blog posts](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog).

I don't want to write a long post about Aaron's life.
Instead, I'll take this chance to talk about
[Open Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access), which was
one of Aaron's main battles as an activist. I'll try to be concise
and go straight to the point.

A word of warning: even though I pledged not to write "political" posts
in this blog, I do have a strong opinion on this subject, and I won't
try to hide it.

## Open access

Most academic journals make scientific articles available at very high
prices, making them practically unaccessible for people who are not
affiliated with a university in a wealthy country. To make things worse,
the people involved in producing these articles - the scientists who
write them and those who review them - do not get any revenue from this.

This system made sense before the Internet, when distributing journals
actually required some effort. The only reasons academics rely on it
nowadays are prestige and having their work reviewed. The latter is a
necessary step for science, and not many peer-reviewed journals offer
open access.

I believe the existence of academic journals that do not offer open access
is unacceptable in the present day. As Aaron Swartz wrote in his 2008
[*Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto*](./goam.txt), sharing knowledge is
a moral imperative. I do stand by this principle.

The *Manifesto* may have had little practical
consequnces, but it has probably inspired
[Alexandra Elbakyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Elbakyan)
to create [Sci-Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub) in 2011.
Sci-Hub is an online repository that gives free access to millions
of research papers. This is of course illegal in most countries, but
for many people it is the only way to access this material. For legal
reasons the website is forced to change domain from time to time, but
it is currently accessible at [sci-hub.ru](https://sci-hub.ru).

Thanks to the Internet we could all have easy access to an incredible
amount of knowledge, but some of it is still locked behind a paywall.
I am hopeful this will change, and the people who fought against this
system will be remembered as heroes, not criminals. But the path to get
there is still long.

## Eulogy
