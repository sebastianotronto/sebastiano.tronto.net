## Tutorials

* [fmctutorial](https://git.tronto.net/fmctutorial): an in-depth
  tutorial for the Rubik's cube *Fewest Moves Challenge*, or FMC.

## Programs and scripts

I started writing code in 2005, with a toy programming language called Dark
Basic first and with Java shortly after that. In the past I enjoyed learning
different programming languages (C++, J, Python...), but I have recently found
more pleasure in writing software in plain C.

* [nissy](https://git.tronto.net/nissy): A Rubik's cube solver,
  intended primarily as a tool for practicing FMC.
* [sdep](https://git.tronto.net/sdep): A minimalistic
  "date+event" line parser. Can be used in combination with some shell scripts
  as a reminder / calendar application.
* [scripts](https://git.tronto.net/scripts): Various scripts
  for Unix-like systems.

## Math courses and programs

Here are some scripts I wrote and lecture notes for some courses
I taught at the [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu)
(2018-2022).

* [mathsoftware](https://git.tronto.net/mathsoftware): a full
  course (3 ECTS) on LaTeX and SageMath.
* [preplogic](https://git.tronto.net/preplogic): notes and
  exercises for two introductory lectures on elementary logic.
* [kummer-degrees](https://git.tronto.net/kummer-degrees): a
  SageMath script for computing the degrees of Kummer extensions of the
  rational numbers.
* [arithmeticbilliard](https://git.tronto.net/arithmeticbilliard):
  a python program for drawing the path of 2- and 3-dimensional arithmetic
  billiards.

## Miscellanea

* [My personal website](https://git.tronto.net/sebastiano.tronto.net):
  source files (mostly markdown) and build scripts for this website.
