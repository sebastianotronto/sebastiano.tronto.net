# Git repositories

I started writing code in 2005, with a toy programming language called Dark
Basic first and with Java shortly after that. In the past I enjoyed learning
different programming languages (C++, J, Python...), but I have recently found
more pleasure in writing software in plain C.

You can find all my git repositories at
[git.tronto.net](https://git.tronto.net/) or on
[my github page](https://github.com/sebastianotronto).
You can clone a repository with `git clone https://git.tronto.net/[NAME]`.

Here are some highlights of what you can find in my git repositories.

## Programs and scripts

* [nissy](https://git.tronto.net/nissy): A Rubik's cube solver,
  intended primarily as a tool for practicing FMC. Since april 2023
  the project has been split into the FMC trainer
  [nissy-fmc](https://git.tronto.net/nissy-fmc) and the optimal solver
  [nissy-nx](https://git.tronto.net/nissy-nx). Both are work in
  progress. The stable version is available at
  [nissy-classic](https://git.tronto.net/nissy-classic), and is
  maintained with bugfixes.
  Check out also [the project's homepage](https://nissy.tronto.net).
* [sdep](https://git.tronto.net/sdep): A minimalistic
  "date+event" line parser. Can be used in combination with some shell scripts
  as a reminder / calendar application.
* [scripts](https://git.tronto.net/scripts): Various scripts
  for Unix-like systems.

## Tutorials

* [fmctutorial](https://git.tronto.net/fmctutorial): an in-depth
  tutorial for the Rubik's cube *Fewest Moves Challenge*, or FMC.

## Math courses and programs

Here are some scripts I wrote and lecture notes for some courses
I taught at the [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu)
(2018-2022).

* [mathsoftware](https://git.tronto.net/mathsoftware): a full
  course (3 ECTS) on LaTeX and SageMath.
* [preplogic](https://git.tronto.net/preplogic): notes and
  exercises for two introductory lectures on elementary logic.
* [kummer-degrees](https://git.tronto.net/kummer-degrees): a
  SageMath script for computing the degrees of Kummer extensions of the
  rational numbers.
* [arithmeticbilliard](https://git.tronto.net/arithmeticbilliard):
  a python program for drawing the path of 2- and 3-dimensional arithmetic
  billiards.

## Miscellanea

* [My personal website](https://git.tronto.net/sebastiano.tronto.net):
  source files (mostly markdown) and build scripts for this website.
* [My git hooks](https://git.tronto.net/git-hooks), used to keep my
  web git instance up do date automatically when I push new changes. See
  [this blog post](https://sebastiano.tronto.net/blog/2022-11-23-git-host).
* [Platonic solids](https://git.tronto.net/platonicsolids) in TikZ (LaTeX).
