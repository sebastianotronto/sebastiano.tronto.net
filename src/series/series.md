# List of blog series

In my [blog](../blog) I sometimes write multiple posts on the same topic,
or I write posts in multiple parts. This page contains the list of these
"blog series".

**Note:** This is *not* a full list of my blog posts divided by topic.

## The man page reading club

In these posts I walk through the [manual page](https://man.openbsd.org)
of a classic UNIX utility, highlighting the most important features.
Each post is introduced by a fictional context.

## UNIX text filter

In this series I explore three classic UNIX commands, in increasing order

This series contains only one post for now, but I may add more in the future.
