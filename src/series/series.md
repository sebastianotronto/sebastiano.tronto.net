# List of blog series

I my [blog](../blog) I sometimes write multiple posts on the same
topic, or posts in multiple parts. This page contains the list of these
"blog series".

**Note:** This is *not* a full list of my blog posts divided by topic.

## The man page reading club

In these posts I walk through the [manual page](https://man.openbsd.org)
of a classic UNIX utility, highlighting the most important features.
Each post is introduced by a fictional context.

* [shutdown(8)](../blog/2022-07-07-shutdown)
* [sh(1) part 1](../blog/2022-09-13-sh-1)

## UNIX text filter

In this series I explore three classic UNIX commands, in increasing order
of complexity: `grep`, `sed` and `awk`. Work in progress.

* [grep](../blog/2023-08-20-grep)
* sed [coming soon]
* awk [coming less soon]

## The UNIX shell as an IDE

This series contains only one post for now, but I may add more in the future.

* [Look stuff up with sed](../blog/2022-06-12-shell-ide-sed)
